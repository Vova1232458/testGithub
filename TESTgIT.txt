 I switched to IT because it is the most dynamic and fastest growing industry in the world. 
I am an inquisitive person and an avid reader, always looking for ways to solve challenging problems. 
The fact that IT jobs are in high demand and offer high pay is just the icing on the cake.
Why stay stuck with legacy systems and servers, and the boatload of financial responsibilities (maintenance and whatnot) that come with them, when you can work lighter, faster, and for way less on the cloud?
Why even stay stuck to the four walls of the office, when you (and your team) can experience the true FREEDOM of working hyper-productively from anywhere, with greater security?
